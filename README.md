# 🏠 StayZ

> *Find your vibe. Find your place.*

StayZ is a modern room listing platform built for **bachelors and Gen Z renters** — people who care about location, vibe, and who they're living around, not just square footage. No bloated forms, no boomer UX. Just clean listings, honest reviews, and fast search.

---

## 🎨 Theme & Vision

StayZ is built for the generation that moves fast — students, young professionals, first-time renters. The aesthetic is **dark, minimal, and modern**. Think Airbnb meets Zomato but stripped down for people who just want a decent room near their college or office.

The product is unapologetically **Gen Z-first**:

- Mobile-first design
- Instant search, no page reloads
- Filters that match real living preferences (co-ed, furnished, PG, single room)
- No unnecessary steps between "find room" and "contact owner"

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/UtkarshSoni1/stayz.git
cd stayz

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in the values — see .env.example for all required keys
```

**Required `.env` variables:**

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Pooled PostgreSQL connection (Neon recommended) |
| `DIRECT_URL` | Direct PostgreSQL connection (used by Prisma migrate) |
| `AUTH_SECRET` | 32-character secret for Auth.js JWT signing |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL` | Base URL, e.g. `http://localhost:3000` |
| `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID` | Google OAuth client ID |
| `AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET` | Google OAuth client secret |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | Public base URL (used in client code) |
| `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` | Cloudinary cloud name |
| `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` | Cloudinary API key |
| `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` | Cloudinary API secret |
| `EMAIL_HOST` | SMTP host (e.g. `smtp.gmail.com`) |
| `EMAIL_PORT` | SMTP port (default `587`) |
| `EMAIL_USER` | SMTP username |
| `EMAIL_PASS` | SMTP password |
| `EMAIL_FROM` | Sender address (default `StayZ <noreply@stayz.in>`) |
| `CRON_SECRET` | Authorization token for cron endpoints |

> **Email dev mode:** If `EMAIL_HOST` / `EMAIL_USER` / `EMAIL_PASS` are not set, email links are printed to the console — no real SMTP needed for local development.


```bash
# 4. Run DB migrations
npx prisma migrate dev

# 5. Seed dev data
npx prisma db seed

# 6. Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
